#  ðŸŽ« Ticketing System
Ticketing system is crucial as it tracks, organizes, and prioritizes customer issues, ensuring efficient resolution, accountability, and improved service delivery. It also provides valuable data for performance analysis and continuous improvement. This is the reason I am using Jira Service Management to experience how ticket is created, solved, assigned, commented, and responded to the customer. I have created and resolved 2 tickets.

## Ticket 1: 404 error on website, Priority: Low
